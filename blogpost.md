#Â Test the Latest Couchbase Features with a Docker Image

We're lucky to have a smart and active team of developers at Couchbase and they often come up with new things for us try out! If you follow this blog you might have seen we published a developer preview for our free text search tool [CBFT](http://blog.couchbase.com/announcing-cbft-developer-preview) and for the [query workbench](http://blog.couchbase.com/2015/october/announcing-the-couchbase-query-workbench-dp1). 

The goal of these early developer previews is to gather your feedback and act on it during our development. And this is something really important as it helps us shape a better product. So what I want to do is make it easier for you test these things.

To me the easiest way to test new software in 2016 is dockerunning it. Yes dockerun is a verb. I created a new Docker image that features a preconfigured Couchbase instance with the travel and beer sample imported as well as the data, index and query services activated. [CBFT](http://labs.couchbase.com/cbft/) and the [query workbench](http://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/4.1/developer-guide/query-workbench-intro.html) will also be running in the same image.

Everything in just one image so that all you have to do to test our new features is 

    docker run -P --rm -p 8091:8091 -p 8094:8094 -p 8095:8095 ldoguin/couchbase-dp

Once your image is running, get the ip of the container and you'll have access to Couchabse on port 8091, the query workbench on port 8094 and CBFT on port 8095. If you're hosting the Docker image locally, those ports will be forwarded onto some other ports but Docker will tell you which ports to use.

If you are using Kinematic it's even simpler. Search the hub for couchbase-dp and you should be able to create an image from it and start testing. I made a short video of it:

<script charset="ISO-8859-1" src="//fast.wistia.com/assets/external/E-v1.js" async></script><div class="wistia_embed wistia_async_7x81xej4kv" style="height:400px;width:640px">&nbsp;</div>

In the video, the fulltext query I ran in CBFT were using [Bleve](http://www.blevesearch.com/) as the indexer. You can find the detailed query string documentation [here](http://www.blevesearch.com/docs/Query-String-Query/). Bleve is a full-text search and indexing library for Go. It's one of Couchabse's most active open source projects too!

If you test CBFT and the query workbench, please give us your feedback and tell us how we can make these better. Thanks!
